The LACE Index Score Calculator is a Streamlit web application designed to assess the risk of post-discharge readmission or death within 30 days for patients who have been hospitalized. The calculator implements the LACE index scoring system, which takes into account the Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidities, and Emergency department visits.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the application works:

1. **Length of Stay (Step 1)**:
   The user inputs the total number of days the patient has been in the hospital, including the day of admission and discharge. The application provides a corresponding score based on the length of stay, with longer stays contributing to a higher risk score.

2. **Acuity of Admission (Step 2)**:
   The user indicates whether the patient was admitted to the hospital through the emergency department, which implies a more acute and possibly more severe condition. An acute admission increases the LACE score by 3 points.

3. **Comorbidities (Step 3)**:
   The application calculates the Charlson Comorbidity Index based on the patient's medical history and active conditions. This index is a prognostic indicator and assigns points for a range of comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, and others. It serves as an essential input for the LACE score calculation.

4. **Emergency Department Visits (Step 4)**:
   The user reports the number of times the patient has visited the emergency department in the six months prior to the current hospital admission, excluding the visit that led to the current admission. The score increases with the number of visits, reflecting the patient's ongoing healthcare needs.

After all the data is input, the user can calculate the total LACE score by clicking on the "Calculate LACE Score" button. The application sums up the individual scores from each category to produce a total LACE score, which is then displayed to the user. The final score ranges from 0 to 19, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of readmission or death within 30 days post-discharge.

The LACE Index Score Calculator provides healthcare professionals with a quick and user-friendly tool to aid in the evaluation of patients at the time of discharge planning. It assists in identifying those at higher risk who may benefit from more intensive post-discharge care to prevent adverse outcomes.
